I am a freelance software engineer and consultant after having worked in such roles for over ten years in the financial and IT industry.
Before that I earned a Diploma and Doctorate in Physics at the Friedrich-Alexander Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg.

I like to analyze, design and build complex systems keeping the KISS principle in mind.
It is important to me to understand the business domain I am working with.
Agile software development using tools like continuous delivery are closer to my heart than big design up front and the waterfall method.
Although as a trained software architect I know that *some* up-front design is generally necessary.
I also like working remotely.
