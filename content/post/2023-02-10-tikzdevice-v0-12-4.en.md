Yesterday [tikzDevice](https://www.daqana.org/tikzDevice/) version 0.12.4 made
it unto [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tikzDevice) and is now
propagating to the mirrors.

The tikzDevice package provides a graphics output device for R that records plots in a LaTeX-friendly format. The device transforms plotting commands issued by R functions into LaTeX code blocks. When included in a paper typeset by LaTeX, these blocks are interpreted with the help of [TikZ](https://pgf-tikz.github.io/)&mdash;a graphics package for TeX and friends written by Till Tantau.

In this release I finally merged PR [#206](https://github.com/daqana/tikzDevice/pull/206) from Paul Murrell to make `tikzDevice` compatible with the graphics engine in R >= 4.1. And Dean Scarff made sure that `tikzInfo->outColorFileName` is always initialized ([#200](https://github.com/daqana/tikzDevice/pull/200) fixing [#199](https://github.com/daqana/tikzDevice/issues/199)). In addition I have also added the current working directory is to `TEXINPUTS` ([#203](https://github.com/daqana/tikzDevice/pull/203) fixing [#197](https://github.com/daqana/tikzDevice/issues/197) and [#198](https://github.com/daqana/tikzDevice/issues/198)).

The main motivation for this release was a new WARNING on CRAN that could have triggered the removal of the package. ([#219](https://github.com/daqana/tikzDevice/pull/219) fixing [#218](https://github.com/daqana/tikzDevice/issues/218)) The WARNING was triggered by the last remaining call to the standard C library function `sprintf()`. This function is insecure due to the possibility of buffer overflows, so it is a good idea to replace it with `snprintf()` where one needs the specify the number of characters to be printed. Normally this is straight forward, since one only has to call `strlen()` on all arguments and add the results. But in this case there is an integer number among the arguments, so I opted for taking the logarithm to determine the length:

```c
    snprintf(tikzInfo->outFileName,
             strlen(tikzInfo->originalColorFileName) + floor(log10(tikzInfo->pageNum)) + 1,
             tikzInfo->originalFileName,
             tikzInfo->pageNum);
```
