I have [blogged](https://blog.daqana.com/en/fast-random-numbers-for-r-with-dqrng/)
[about](https://blog.daqana.com/en/first-cran-release-for-dqrng/)
[dqrng](https://blog.daqana.com/en/dqrng-v0-0-5-new-and-updated-rngs/)
[before](https://blog.daqana.com/en/dqrng-v0-1-0-breaking-changes-2/), but I
forgot to write about the v0.2.0 release, even though that brought a lot of
changes including the 
[fast sampling methods](https://blog.daqana.com/en/fast-sampling-support-in-dqrng/)
to CRAN:

* Add R side support for selecting multiple streams for parallel usage.
* Implement `long_jump()` for Xo(ro)shiro as alternative to `jump()`
  providing fewer streams with longer period.
* Handle R's RNG scope properly during initialisation.
* New functions `dqsample` and `dqsample.int` using an unbiased sampling
  algorithm.
* Use `R_unif_index()` instead of `unif_rand()` to retrieve random data
  from R's RNG in `generateSeedVectors()`.
* Scalar RNGs in the C++ API: `dqrng::runif`, `dqrng::rnorm` and `dqrng::rexp`

The list of changes for v0.2.1, which [made it onto CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dqrng) today, is much shorter:

* Make template specialisations `inline` and include required standard headers (Aaron Lun in [#29](https://github.com/daqana/dqrng/pull/29) fixing [#28](https://github.com/daqana/dqrng/issues/28))
* Add workaraound for new C++ compiler with old libc ([#30](https://github.com/daqana/dqrng/pull/30) fixing [#27](https://github.com/daqana/dqrng/issues/27))
* Update maintainer's email address
